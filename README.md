# Winters-Icons
An icon pack inspired for the winter season

The driving force to create these icons was to create a way 
for developers to use icons free of attribution and licensing 
hazards in their prjoects. 
These icons are totally free to use in whatever way you want
except for hosting these icons somewhere else and branding them as your own creation. Attribution is not at all compulsory but you can if you want to.

### Available Flavours
